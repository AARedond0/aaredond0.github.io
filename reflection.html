    <p>
      This book does not end when the last page is read.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a thought lingered, a question surfaced, or something shifted quietly within you,
      you are welcome to leave a reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no requirement to explain or resolve anything here.
      This space is private, unhurried, and offered simply as a place to name
      what your experience has been.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for reading with care.
    </p>
