    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p>
      This book is offered as a place to pause rather than proceed.
      It does not rush toward conclusions, but makes room for attention,
      honesty, and what may quietly unfold.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was written from a place of attention rather than haste, and it
      does not seek agreement or resolution. What it asks for is honesty—
      before God, before the questions you carry, and before what remains
      unfinished.
    </p>

    <p>
      What you encounter here may not arrive clearly or all at once.
      That is not a failure of understanding, but part of how faith often
      deepens—quietly, beneath certainty, through what lingers rather than
      what is resolved.
    </p>

    <p>
      If something stays with you after reading—a question, a resistance,
      or a quiet recognition—allow it to remain. Some experiences do not
      ask to be explained, only to be noticed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you find yourself slowed, settled, or quietly drawn inward,
      allow that to be enough.<br>
      Not everything that changes us announces itself loudly.
    </p>
